# Authentication
We issue API keys for the platform. The API is accessible through the API Keys put in as Bearer tokens.

## Steps
1. Sign up on the [Alchemyst Platform](https://platform.getalchemystai.com)
2. Go to [Settings](https://platform.getalchemystai.com/settings)
3. You will have a default key. Use that, or create one for ease of use.
4. Paste the API Key in your OpenAI SDK calls (if you use the LLM proxy), or in the calls to the other APIs. Refer [Getting started](https://alchemyst-ai.github.io/awesome-saas/#learn-about-the-alchemyst-apis) to get started with the other APIs.
